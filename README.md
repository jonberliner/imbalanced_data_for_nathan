# imbalanced_data_for_nathan
comparing different methods for imbalanced data with linear regression

requires sklearn, scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
run example with synthetic data with `python main.py`
atm, need to manually rewrite main script to take in your real data instead of synthetic

## files
+ **main.py**: defines and runs experiments with different balancing methods
+ **balanced_samplers.py**: functions for sampling data to get class balance
+ **util.py**: contains function for cross validation
